# Getting Started

## Welcome!

As an Equinix employee you are free to create a repo within the Equinix Labs Organization. The aim is for there to be a low barrier to entry for anyone who wants to keep a repo here and so we don't have many hard rules and requirements and there is no permission required or approval process to go through - you just create!

Having said that, we do expect that you take a responsible approach to using this space and make time to properly document and maintain your repo, including responding to issues and support requests, and end-of-lifing it when it's no longer needed.

## Meeting the required standards
In the `equinix-labs` repo we have a number of templates and resources that you are free to use to help you populate your new repo. Of particular note are the 3 standards for repos. We recommend you pick one and align your repo to it.
